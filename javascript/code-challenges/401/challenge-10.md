# Stacks and Queues
Stacks and Queues as a data structure that is similar to linked lists 

## Challenge Summary
The challenge is to implement a stack and queue using the basis of what a linked-list is. Features must include the ability to add, remove, check for value, as well as check if empty

## Whiteboard Process
N/A

## Approach & Efficiency
Following given directions from Code Challenge, the given readings, as well as referencing the format and methods of linked lists, I will use the following to make my methods and tests. 

## Solution
By analyzing the readings and the format of a linked list, I was able to create methods and tests for the stacks and queues challenge.
