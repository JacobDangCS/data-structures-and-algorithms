# Graphs
Starting with a new implementation of a data structure, we are working with graphs. The graph is equivalent to an adjacency list and there are multiple ways to traverse a graph.

## Challenge
The challenge involves creating the method depth first. Depth first traversal is something that other data structures utilize as well, and in simple terms, it's traversing a data structure from the 

## Approach & Efficiency
Using past methods that share similar fundamentals as well as reading into depth first method for graphs will be useful for approach.
