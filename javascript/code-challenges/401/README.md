# Graphs
Starting with a new implementation of a data structure, we are working with graphs. The graph is equivalent to an adjacency list and there are multiple ways to traverse a graph.

## Challenge
The challenge involves creating methods that utilize the adjacency list idea and implement the following:
- add node
- add edge
- get node
- get neighbor
- size


## Approach & Efficiency
Using past methods that share similar fundamentals as well as reading into graph methods

## UML
N/A

## API
- addVertex(value) 

- addDirectedEdge(startVertex, endVertex, weight = 0)

- getNeighbors(vertex)

- getNodes()

- breadFirst(root, callback)

- depthFirst(root, callback)
