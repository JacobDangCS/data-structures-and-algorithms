# Hashtables
Hashtables are used to store and retreive key value pairs, where values can be retrieved using keys. This data structure differs from previous ones we've learned because this structure allows for direct communication rather than a traversal 

## Challenge
This challenge involves implementing a new data structure and new methods that correspond with the data structure, methods include 
- set: Initializes the hash
- get: Retrieves the hash
- has: Checks if it exists
- keys: Retrieves keys
- hash: Retrieves the index for a key

## Approach & Efficiency
The approach taken for this involves understanding how hash tables work and how they correspond in context to utilizing methods.

## API
- set: Initializes the hash
- get: Retrieves the hash
- has: Checks if it exists
- keys: Retrieves keys
- hash: Retrieves the index for a key
